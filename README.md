# spectral-digitizer
Code for the spectral digitization project which will be outlined [in more detail here](http://cthierauf.com/projects/platedigitize/).
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to  digitize spectral plates. This code provides the command line, performs the handshake with the camera, and controls the stepper motor to allow for that to occur.
## Installing This Project
Using the XC8 C compiler from Microchip, this code can be programmed onto the hardware via something like the PICkit 2 that we've used. Alternatively, use the MPLAB IDE from Microchip to open this repository as a project so that it can then be downloaded.
## Using the Code
Once installed and running, try using the 'help' command to get an idea of what can be done. A better user manual can be found online at the link above when the documentation is up-to-date.
